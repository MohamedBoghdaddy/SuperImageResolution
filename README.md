# 🖼️ SuperImageResolution

## 🚀 Overview
**SuperImageResolution** is an AI-powered project that enhances the resolution of low-quality images using cutting-edge deep learning models. It leverages state-of-the-art neural networks to improve image clarity, making it perfect for tasks like image restoration, upscaling, and photo enhancement.

## ✨ Features
- 🧠 **Deep Learning Model**: Neural networks trained for high-quality image super-resolution.
- 🔍 **Image Upscaling**: Enhance the resolution of low-quality or pixelated images.
- ⚙️ **Customizable Scaling Factor**: Define how much to upscale your image (e.g., 2x, 4x).
- 💽 **Pretrained Models**: Load and use pretrained models for quick testing and results.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- 🐍 **Python**  
- 🔥 **TensorFlow / PyTorch**  
- 📷 **OpenCV**  
- 🧮 **NumPy**

## 💻 Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MohamedBoghdaddy/SuperImageResolution.git
   ```
   
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd SuperImageResolution
   ```

3. **Install required dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the model:**
   ```bash
   python super_resolution.py
   ```

5. **Upscale an image with custom scaling:**
   ```bash
   python super_resolution.py --input path/to/low_res_image.jpg --scale 2
   ```

   - `--input`: Path to the input image file.
   - `--scale`: The upscaling factor (e.g., 2x, 4x).

## 🔍 Results
Here’s a comparison of a low-resolution image before and after applying the model:

| 🖼️ **Before**  | 🖼️ **After**  |
| --------------- | -------------- |
| ![Low-Res](path/to/before.jpg) | ![High-Res](path/to/after.jpg) |

## 🛠️ Future Improvements
- ⏳ **Real-time Upscaling**: Implement real-time image upscaling for live processing.
- 🎥 **Video Enhancement**: Extend support for enhancing video resolution.

### Icons and emojis added:
- Emojis like 🧠, 🔍, ⚙️, and 💽 are added for each feature to enhance readability.
- Technology section includes icons related to each tool or language used.
- Visual appeal through the use of emojis in section titles and key features.

This revised README is more visually engaging and easier to scan, while keeping all the necessary technical details.
