# SuperImageResolution

## Overview
SuperImageResolution is an AI-based project that enhances the resolution of low-quality images using deep learning. The project leverages state-of-the-art neural networks to improve image clarity, making it useful for tasks like image restoration, upscaling, and photo enhancement.

## Features
- **Deep Learning Model**: Trained neural networks designed for image super-resolution.
- **Image Upscaling**: Increase the resolution of low-quality or pixelated images.
- **Customizable Scaling Factor**: Option to define the scaling factor for resolution enhancement.
- **Pretrained Model**: Load and use pretrained models for quick testing.
  
## Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow / PyTorch
- OpenCV
- Numpy

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MohamedBoghdaddy/SuperImageResolution.git
cd SuperImageResolution
pip install -r requirements.txt
python super_resolution.py
python super_resolution.py --input path/to/low_res_image.jpg --scale 2
--input: Path to the input image file.
--scale: The upscaling factor (e.g., 2x, 4x).
Results
Below is a comparison of a low-resolution image before and after applying the model:

Future Improvements
Implement real-time image upscaling.
Add support for video resolution enhancement.
